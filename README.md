Kalaha
=======================================

Overview
-----------

This program provides an implementation of an AI agent for the board game Kalaha using the MINIMAX algorithm with additional alpha-beta pruning. Three different version of alpha-beta pruning are implemented and can be tested by the user.

Setup
-----------

First Python 3 has to be downloaded and installed. In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

Otherwise python can be downloaded and installed from

 	https://www.python.org/downloads/

Next the the module numpy needs to be installed
	$ pip3 install numpy

Usage
-----------
In order to run the program type the following command in the terminal

	$ pip3 Kalaha.py

The choice of pocket when playing is controlled by typing the index of the respective pocket. The index ranges from 0 to 5 if a game of six pockets for each players is being played. The pocket with index 0 is the pocket farthest away from the player's Kalaha.

For playing against the most efficient algorithm choose 'Alpha-beta w. evaluation function 1'.
